Took staff, five smooth stones from brook, sling. Goliath disdained him: 'Am I a dog?' David said 'Thou comest to me with sword... I come to thee in the name of the LORD.'

Forty days later, ten spies brought evil report - giants in land, we were as grasshoppers. People wanted return to Egypt. Only Caleb and Joshua gave good report. Caleb said 'Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.' People wanted stone them. God's glory appeared. Moses interceded. God decreed that generation would die in wilderness - but Caleb and Joshua would enter. Reason: Caleb 'had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully.' Wandered 40 years. At 85 years old, Caleb claimed mountain God promised - where giants were. 'If so be the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out.' Received Hebron as inheritance.
